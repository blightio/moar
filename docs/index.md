# moar

moar (pronounce "more") is a modular augmentation registry for VueJS and ReactJS.

# But why?

Based on [Distributed vue applications](https://markus.oberlehner.net/blog/distributed-vue-applications-loading-components-via-http/)
by Markus Oberlehner this registry is a central hub for managing UMD modules for VueJS and ReactJS applications.

# Try it

1. run docker-compose up in the ./docker directory to start the registry
2. create your first module
3. upload a version of the module
4. making sure everything is in place
